Meeting with Marcus - 2:30 - 3:05

Discussed various aspects of the project, the overall goals and the initial steps.

CERN VISIT
- There is a visit from CERN on 3rd Nov. Members of Open Lab will be visiting.
- To prepare for this, I should:
  - Look at existing workflows for storing neuroscience data (fMRI etc.). PACS is one such system (a DB which stores neuroscience recordings etc). Mike knows about these systems.
  - Look at the OS that is best to handle the DB (generally the specification of the system needed to handle the neuroscience data). There is a 'new' debian solution which comes packaged with neuroscience tools (but it is poorly supported, only by two people). Decide on a UNIX system to use for the VM.
  - Likely to use a VM to run the OS, which handles the DB. The VM will interface to a cluster, and receive data which is fedback.

DB:
My understanding is that the OS will hold the DB, which contains the experimental neuroscience data, as well as the output from VERTEX. It is within this environment that a comparison can take place between the two data-sets. Look at PACS, or possibly some MSSQL implementation. There is a question about whether PACS can deal with timeseries of data. The DB will need to support this. I will look at the Human Connectome Project to influence this decision. They already have systems in place to handle this.

More on that comparison:
- I was provided a masters thesis paper by Stuart Maitland on Simulated Annealing of Cortical networks. This can be used to construct networks which get close to real data.

PSOM (the workflow bit):
Mentioned PyNE and NEST for simulating the neurones.

Mentioned a need for identifying an ontology to use:
- There are many ways that the brain can be divided up. Look into the types of ontologies available.
- INCF.org has information on this:
  - What software/documentation is available?
  - Marcus provided me with booklets on this. 

Mentioned a need for some UML tool:
- Look at UML/BrainML for describing data formats?
- Related to ontologies?

A note about how the biological data is handled:
Graphs are constructed from algorithms which look at JPEG images of the brain (MRI). CIFTI and NIFTI are data formats from the MRI images.

A note about the lectures:
- Marcus recommeneded that I attend a weekly Systems Neuroscience lecture as part of the Medical school. Also a disection course with this (disect the human brain).
- Also mentioned that I should attend a series of lectures in Feb - 3 weeks - complex systems.
- Week 5 + 6, Brain connectivity.

Outcomes:
- Priority on preparing for CERN visit on 3rd Nov.
- Investigate a PACS/MSSQL solution for storing(!) neurscience data (talk to Mike - what systems are available). ***How to run this on a VM? What specs are needed?***
  - Ideally start to implement this.
- Investigate PSOM - there is a paper which Marcus has sent. Look at PyNE, NEST, BrainX3 (Barcelona) for simulating neurones.
- Investigate MSA (Multiple Shapely Analysis) - Marcus uses this in his PhD thesis [2005, page 111] (likely linked to his Google Scholar page). Also go to the website which is listed on the initial proposal document.
- VERTEX - Chris Thornton knows about working with VERTEX.
- Ontologies to use which describe how to divide the brain up. INCF.org.
- UML - BrainML.
